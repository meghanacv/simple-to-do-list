# Simple To-Do List
A simple to-do list based on an exercise in Colt Steele's ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy.

### How It Works

- To remove a to-do item, hover over the item and click the trash can icon.
- To mark an item as complete, click once on the item.
- To hide the input box, click on the plus sign.
